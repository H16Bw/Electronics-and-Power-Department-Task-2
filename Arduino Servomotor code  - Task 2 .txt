//The steps in the code can be described as follows:;

//1. Library Inclusion: The code includes the Servo library using `#include <Servo.h>`. This allows us to control servo motors.;

//2. Servo Object Creation: The code creates a servo object named `myServo` using `Servo myServo;`. This object will be used to control the servo motor.;

//3. Variable Declaration: The code declares an integer variable named `servoPosition` and initializes it to 0. This variable will hold the current position of the servo motor.;

//4. Setup Function: The code defines the `setup()` function. In this function, the servo object is attached to pin 2 using `myServo.attach(2);`. This sets up the servo motor to be controlled through pin 2.;

//5. Loop Function: The code defines the `loop()` function, which contains the main logic of the program.;

//6. First For Loop: The first `for` loop is used to sweep the servo motor from position 0 to 180 degrees. It starts at `servoPosition = 0` and increments `servoPosition` by 1 in each iteration. Inside the loop, the `myServo.write(servoPosition)` command sets the servo motor to the current position. The `delay(10)` command adds a delay of 10 milliseconds between each position change.;

//7. Second For Loop: The second `for` loop is similar to the first loop but is used to sweep the servo motor back from 180 to 0 degrees. It starts at `servoPosition = 180` and decrements `servoPosition` by 1 in each iteration.;

//The `loop()` function will continuously repeat these steps, causing the servo motor to sweep back and forth between 0 and 180 degrees.;
